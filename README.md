# Virtual Tour Experience

Welcome to the Virtual Tour Experience project! This project aims to provide a unique and immersive way for people to explore and experience various places from the comfort of their own homes before making a commitment to visit in person. We achieve this by integrating a virtual tour playground into a web application, inspired by Headout, which allows users to navigate through different destinations using Babylon.js, a powerful 3D rendering engine.
